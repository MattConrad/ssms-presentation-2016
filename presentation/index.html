            <p>SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS): used for database administration and ad-hoc interaction with your database.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Programmers typically use SSMS for testing queries, but there's a lot more.</p>
            <br />
            <p class="small">(Another common way to interact with the db ad-hocly is to use the built in database access tools with Visual Studio. These work similarly to SSMS, and much of tonight's presentation applies to those tools as well.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <p>Getting SSMS</p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p class="medium">If you already have a database engine installed (like LocalDB/SQL Server Express that comes with Visual Studio), 
                you can get SSMS standalone at <a href=" https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt238290.aspx"> https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt238290.aspx</a>.</p>
            <br />
            <p class="medium">Or you can download SQL Server Developer 
                edition for free at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-editions-developers">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-editions-developers</a>.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <p>A quick remark about tonight's presentation:</p>
            <br />
            <p class="medium">Like Visual Studio, SSMS is really big. I will be skipping over things that I think are obscure, less important, or that I don't use/don't understand very well. If we pass over some items without remark, that's why. (Probably.)</p>
            <br />
            <p class="medium">
                One significant omission worth mentioning: <strong>SQL Server Agent.</strong>
                SQL Agent lets you schedule SQL commands to run later, or on a repeated schedule. You’ll probably schedule backups using SQL Agent, 
                and it tends to accumulate other responsibilities as your system grows. We don't have time to get into Agent tonight, but if you work with
                SQL Server much, you'll want to get familiar with it.
            </p>

        <section>
            <div class="pleft3">
                <p>The Query Window</p>
                <br />
                <ul class="medium">
                    <li>Enter a query and hit F5 (or Ctrl-E) to run it.</li>
                    <li>Open new query windows (each with a new active database connection) using Alt-N.</li>
                    <li>Comments are double dashes. Use Ctrl-K, Ctrl-C as a block comment shortcut</li>
                    <li>If you highlight part of the text and hit Run, only the highlighted text is run. This is <strong>very handy</strong>.</li>
                    <li>You can change your results format from grid, to text, to file output.</li>
                </ul>

        <section>
            <p>Browsing the Object Explorer tree</p>
            <br />
            <p class="medium">First, server level properties:</p>
            <br />
            <ul class="medium">
                <li>General: potentially useful stuff you might want to look up</li>
                <li>Server/Memory: straightforward</li>
                <li>Security: auth mode, very significant. Note the difference between database and server login info. Also, “sa” user.</li>
                <li>Database settings: database default locations</li>
                <li>Permissions: logins can get server level permissions</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
                
        <section>
            <p>Databases folder: a quick stop and we'll return later.</p>
            <br />
            <p class="medium">SQL Server has the concept of system databases and user databases</p>
            <br />
            <p class="medium">System databases are built in databases used for managing the server itself</p>
            <br />
            <p class="medium">User databases are made by programmers to hold customized data. If you're not a DBA, you use user databases.</p>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p class="medium">There's much more to talk about here. We'll come back to this in a while.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>Security folder:</p>
            <br />
            <ul class="medium">
                <li>Logins: these are <strong>server level</strong> accounts. Database level <em>users</em> are related, but something different.</li>
                <li>Server Roles: group permissions inside SQL Server, you don't have to apply permissions to every user individually</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>Replication:</p>
            <br />
            <p class="medium">Replication copies data from one SQL server to another, to keep data from multiple servers in sync. It's a whole topic of its own.</p>
            <br />
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>Management:</p>
            <br />
            <ul class="medium">
                <li>SQL Server Logs: Here’s one you’ll probably interact with. If you’re having weird server level issues (SQL Server won’t start, system databases are behaving strangely, etc), you can maybe get a clue from the server logs. Note that if you can’t even connect to SQL Server you can still view the logs from the filesystem, hit Google for “SQL Server log location” for how to find the log files for your SQL Server version.</li>
                <li>On a full install of SQL Server, there will be more here, like database maintenance plans.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <p>Back to Databases:</p>
            <br />
            <p>Right clicking databases: Properties: noteworthy stuff:</p>
            <br />
            <ul class="medium">
                <li>General: size</li>
                <li>Files: databases are files, usually two files, data and log</li>
                <li>Options: Collation, Recovery Model (important!), Compatiblity Level</li>
                <li>Permissions: Database level permissions, distinct from object level permissions</li>
                <li>Also, in the pane below the page listing, you’ll see View Connection Properties which is sometimes handy.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>Another right clicking databases option: Tasks:</p>
            <br />
            <p>Tasks has a lot of good stuff tucked away. Let's talk about a few in particular:</p>
            <br />
            <ul class="medium">
                <li>Back Up and Restore are essential, of course. If your DBA does this for you, don't worry about it. If you don't have a DBA, learn how back up and restore work (and schedule regular backups).</li>
                <li><strong>You must test your backup restore process</strong> to make sure you know how to restore correctly, and that your backup process is valid. Finding out your backups weren't being done correctly <strong>after</strong> you actually need them isn't pretty, and it does happen.</li>
                <li>Generate Scripts is very good. See that hidden little option that lets you script the data along with the schema.</li>
                <li>Import Data and Export Data are also good when you need them. Move data in or out of Excel spreadsheets, Access databases, text files, etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>Expanding the database tree:</p>
            <br />
            <ul class="medium">
                <li>Database Diagrams: A db diagram lets you view the table structure for your db as a picture. You can also make database modifications from a db diagram.</li>
                <li>Tables: System tables (not actually all shown here), file tables (new to me), user tables. Most people most of the time only care about their user tables. Many things you can do from the table listing. Try right clicking a table! Design, Select N, Edit N, Script Table, all very good.</li>
                <li>Views: System views, user views. (What is a view?) Again, right click a view and see your options.</li>
                <li>Programmability: Many useful db objects live here. We won’t go over all of them tonight, but the use of stored procedures in particular is quite common.</li>
                <li>Security: This is db security, not server security. Don’t get them confused. A database user is linked to a server login, but they’re not the same thing. Roles are group permissions that many users can belong to.</li>
                <li>(a brief discussion of orphaned users after a restore)</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>Useful random stuff:</p>
            <br />
            <ul class="medium">
                <li>Tools - Options, always good to know where your settings are</li>
                <li>If you're viewing results in text, see Query - Query Options - Results - Text - Max Size.</li>
                <li>Template Explorer: handy for beginners. View - Template Explorer</li>
                <li>Refresh Intellisense (Ctrl-Shift-R)</li>
                <li>sp_help</li>
            </ul>
            <br />
